## Overview

[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) is a customer service software company that provides a cloud-based customer support platform. It is designed to offer a seamless and efficient customer service experience, enabling businesses to manage customer interactions across multiple channels, including email, chat, phone, and social media.

The Ballerina Zendesk Connector allows developers to interact with the [Zendesk REST API V2](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/introduction/), making it easier to integrate customer support features into Ballerina applications. This connector enables the automation of Zendesk Support operations such as ticket management, user and organization management, and more.

### Step 4: Configure connection settings

When creating a new connection, you will be prompted to provide the following details:

- **Authentication type**: Possible options are `API key`, `Basic Auth`, `Bearer Token`, and `OAuth 2.0`.
- **Allowed domain**: The domain that the connection is allowed to access. You can use a wildcard to allow requests made
  to any subdomain by adding an asterisk (*) at the start.

## Quickstart

To begin using the `Zendesk` connector in your Ballerina application, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Import the connector

First, import the `ballerinax/zendesk` package into your Ballerina project.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/zendesk;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

Create a `zendesk:ConnectionConfig` object with your domain and API token, and initialize the connector.

```ballerina
zendesk:ConnectionConfig zendeskConfig = {
    auth: {
        username: "<username>",
        password: "<password>"
    }
};

zendesk:Client zendesk = check new (zendeskConfig, "https://<your-domain>.zendesk.com");
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Utilize the connector's operations to manage tickets, users, organizations, etc.

#### Create a ticket

```ballerina
zendesk:TicketCreateRequest ticket = {
    ticket: {
        subject: "Subject of the ticket",
        comment: {
            body: "Body of the ticket comment"
        }
    }
};

zendesk:TicketResponse createResponse = check zendesk->/api/v2/tickets.post(ticket);
```

#### List tickets

```ballerina
zendesk:TicketsResponse tickets = check zendesk->/api/v2/tickets;
```
